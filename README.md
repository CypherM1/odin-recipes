# odin-recipes

In this repo I will be building a basic recipe website only using HTML shown on The Odin Project so far. 

This would include the following:

- Set up the HTML boilerplate.
- Create an orginized file structure.
- Add Header <h1-6> elements.
- Include italicized <em> and bold <strong> elements.
- Insert pictures <img> with the proper attributes <src> <alt>.
- Create relative and/or absolute links <a href>.
