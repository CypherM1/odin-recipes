    <p>What more do I need to say? Lets get started!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>10 egg roll wrappers</li>
        <li>10 mozzarella string cheese sticks</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Beat eggs in a mixing bowl. Whisk in milk, then set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place bread crumbs into a resealable plastic bag; set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Separate and lay an egg roll wrapper onto a flat, clean work surface with one of the tips pointed towards you. Moisten the two far edges of the wrapper with water. Place a string cheese stick onto the corner nearest you, then roll it in 1/3 of the way. Fold over the right and left corners, then continue rolling to the end, pressing to seal. Repeat this step with remaining string cheese sticks and egg roll wrappers.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Dip mozzarella sticks into egg mixture, then toss in bread crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Working in batches, fry breaded mozzarella sticks in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
